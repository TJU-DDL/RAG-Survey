## Acknowledgments


We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the following authors and researchers. Their exceptional contributions in the field of RAG, along with their willingness to share their findings, have been truly commendable.Without their insightful research, invaluable experience, and generous sharing, we would not have been able to present the material associated with RAG as extensively in our survey. We reiterate our profound appreciation to all the researchers, industry professionals, and knowledge sharers. Additionally, we extend our thanks to everyone who has provided us with invaluable insights.
